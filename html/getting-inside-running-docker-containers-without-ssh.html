<p>Jerome Petazzoni of Docker, Inc. <a href="http://blog.docker.com/2014/06/why-you-dont-need-to-run-sshd-in-docker/">published an article on his company's blog</a> to show how people can get inside running Docker containers with a lightweight tool called <a href="https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter"><code>nsenter</code></a>.  By letting people <strong>enter</strong> the Linux kernel <strong>n</strong>ame<strong>s</strong>paces that Docker uses to build containers, <code>nsenter</code> effectively gives them shell access to running Docker containers without SSH daemon.</p>

<p>To make entering a running Docker container even simpler, Docker, Inc. is introducing <code>docker exec</code> with the release of Docker v1.3.0.  The <code>docker exec</code> command spawns a process inside a given Docker container.  By using <code>docker exec</code> to launch a new Bash session inside the running Docker container, developers can more easily debug their Dockerized applications.</p>

<p>Docker is not recommending users to abandon the "one application per container" development pattern with <code>docker exec</code>.  Instead, Docker hopes to wean them off the anti-pattern of running <code>sshd</code> inside their containers.</p>

<p>With the introduction of <code>docker exec</code>, <code>nsenter</code> has officially become obsolete.</p>
